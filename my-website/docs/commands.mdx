With the Kontent Project and Sample site configured, you can now run:

`npm run kontent`

This command runs a custom Docusaurus CLI command that synchronizes the sample project's physical markdown files and *sidebar.js* file with the content stored in the Kentico Kontent headless CMS.

Once the content has been synchronized, entering:

`npm run start`

in the terminal will start the site at ***http://localhost:3000***.
